# Sorting and Filtering Results

Given a results display of several car components, each with their own properties:

```javascript
function Car(model, year, brand, color, msrp, rating) {
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
    this.brand = brand;
    this.color = color;
    this.msrp = msrp;
    this.rating = rating;
  }
```

## Sorting
We can sort the cars based off price (low to high) or (high to low), or alphabetical order.

## Filtering
We can filter the results based off brand, year, color, and rating.
